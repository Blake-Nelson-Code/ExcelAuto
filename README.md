# Excel Automation Project

This very simple project demonstrates how to interact with Excel files using Python. It includes two scripts that automate the creation and manipulation of Excel workbooks using `openpyxl` and `win32com.client`.

## Requirements

To run these scripts, you need the following Python packages installed:
- `openpyxl`
- `pandas`
- `pywin32` (for `win32com`)

You can install the required packages with:
```bash
pip install openpyxl pandas pywin32

python ExcelAuto.py

python ExcelAuto_2.py

This `README.md` file covers both `ExcelAuto.py` and `ExcelAuto_2.py` in one cohesive explanation, including their respective code snippets and usage instructions.
